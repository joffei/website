<h2><b>Adam's Story</b></h2>
&#x201c;Sit down, Malik, please,&#x201d; Ray said.<br/> Malik sat down slowly, wondering where it 
was headed.  <br/>Ray sat down beside him, holding the gun in his hand, looking at it with such anger.  
Tears began to form in Ray&#x2019;s eyes.  He let out a great deep breath and looked at Malik.  
<br/>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never spoken of this story before, so I need your word that you will not 
say a word to anyone,&#x201d; Ray said.<br/> Malik nodded.  Ray opened his hand, requesting the pack 
of cigarettes.  Malik reluctantly handed them to him.  <br/>Ray opened the pack and saw two missing.  
&#x201c;I hate smoking, and I hate smokers.  I don&#x2019;t smoke.  Let me make that clear right now.&#x201d;<br/>&#x201c;Then 
why do you have the cigarettes and the especially the gun,&#x201d; Malik asked.<br/>&#x201c;My little brother, 
Adam,&#x201d; Ray began.  &#x201c;I remember when they had brought him back from the hospital.  I was 
only a child at the time and I had convinced myself that the last thing I wanted in the world was a 
younger sibling.  Our parents owned a zoo, and they would get animals from several different placee, 
near and far.  Night after night they would be out trying to strike a deal with exotic pet collectors, 
zoologists, even people who owned unusual pets and couldn&#x2019;t care for them.  They didn&#x2019;t 
want him sleeping in his own room, fearing something could happen and they wouldn&#x2019;t be there to 
care for him, so they made us roommates from the start.  Several nights, he would wake up crying and I 
would get used to picking him up and letting him sleep with me.  That&#x2019;s when I began telling 
stories.<br/>&#x201c;One day came that Adam fell down a flight of stairs, and we quickly found out 
something tragic that would change everything.  Adam was a hemophiliac.  He bled and bled and we did 
everything we could to stop it, but it was no use.&#x201d;  His little body didn&#x2019;t even hold 
that much blood, so he quickly turned pale.&#x201d;<br/>&#x201c;Did he die?&#x201d; Malik asked with 
soulful eyes.<br/>&#x201c;No, he didn&#x2019;t bleed out from falling down some stairs,&#x201d; Ray 
continued.  &#x201c;He did give us quite a scare, though.  He was in the hospital for a few days.  
My mom, my father and I stayed with him for the entire time.  Miraculously, everyone was so frightened 
except for him.  He would run up and down the halls of the hospital, his arms spread out, buzzing his 
lips, saying &#x2018;I can fly, I can fly&#x2019; in the most childish voice I can remember.  For a 
couple of nights, I would tell him a story of two boys who thought they could fly too.  After a while, 
he became a bit selective about what he found interesting, so he began to add to the stories himself.  
Every night, we would continue the story together.  To this day, I can&#x2019;t remember how the story 
went except that they had a horrible death at the end, and from that moment on, he was terrified of 
airplanes.<br/>I had gotten to the fifth grade and he was still there.  He stayed in that hospital 
for such a long time, we came to know each nurse, doctor, and volunteer by name.  They would see me 
off to school in the morning and greet me as I came back to be with Adam.  I&#x2019;d even forgotten 
what my house looked like.  My parents continued to make new deals, so the rest of us had to keep a 
close eye on him.  Each time he tripped over, my heart would jump.  After a while, the stories stopped.  
He started getting the pale look in his face again and he could barely move.  Some days, he seemed to get 
better, other days, he was just the opposite.  I felt so helpless, so anxious that I started doing something 
that I had never thought to do in my life.&#x201d;<br/>&#x201c;You smoked?&#x201d; Malik asked almost as a sure 
thing.<br/>&#x201c;I prayed,&#x201d; Ray stated.  Malik looked at him questioningly.  &#x201c;When Adam went to 
sleep that night, I sat down, put both palms together with as much force as I could as if it meant something, 
touched them to my forehead, sealed my eyes shut, and said,<br/>&#x2018;Dear God&#x2026;um&#x2026;I know that, 
before, I really didn&#x2019;t want a younger brother or sister or anything, but you sent a really good one to 
me and I really like him now.  I&#x2019;m really sorry that I never really believed in you before, but right 
now, we really need you.  We all really love Adam and we&#x2019;d all be really sad if he went 
away.&#x2019;&#x201d; Tears started running down his eyes looking up at the sky with unstable breath 
and I said, &#x201c;&#x2018;God, he&#x2019;s in a lot of pain right now.  Adam has been nothing but a 
good boy his entire life and he doesn&#x2019;t deserve this.  Please, if you help Adam, I promise 
I&#x2019;ll never complain about him again.  I&#x2019;ll even take him places with me.  I&#x2019;ll 
protect him from any danger.  I&#x2019;ll never let anything happen to him.  I just want him to be 
healthy.  That&#x2019;s all I want.&#x2019;<br/>I don&#x2019;t know if it was the prayer, or the 
medicine, something in the food, or a combination of things, but, the next day, Adam was back on 
his feet, running around.  He seemed to only get better from then on.  In fact, within a couple of 
days, he was discharged from the hospital.  Then, to keep my promise, I convinced my mom and father 
to take us to the zoo to see the animals they had brought in ever since Adam had to be taken care of.  
What a mistake that was.<br/>He took my hand and looked up at me in admiration.  I looked down at him and 
smiled.  Our parents walked prominently in front of us.  Our mom was wearing an all white dress, high heels 
to match, a small purse in her right hand and fake diamond earrings in each ear lobe.  Her eyes were blocked 
from the sun by dark tinted sun glasses with lenses so large, that they covered her eyebrows, and a flower 
pin in her long, wavy, blond hair.  Our father had on slacks and a short sleeve, white dress shirt and black 
loafers.  He took a paper towel from his pocket and wiped sweat from his brow that dripped from his greasy, 
gel filled hair.  I looked at them, then at myself and Adam in his khaki shorts and solid blue tee shirt.  I 
leaned over and whispered into Adam&#x2019;s ear making him laugh and our parents turned and glared at us.  
Adam shut his mouth as if they had not seen him, but once they turned back around, we both started giggling 
at them again.  The smell of animals came at us.  Adam ran to the first pen to see the gorillas, nearly 
knocking our parents down.  I ran after him and told him, &#x2018;stay close to us.  We don&#x2019;t want 
to lose you in here.&#x2019;  He never did really listen to me.  At that moment, I noticed someone sitting 
across from us on the ground next to the chimps&#x2019; cage.  He was the most pitiful thing you could see.  He 
looked like his hair, either on his head or his chin, hadn&#x2019;t been tended to in weeks.  He was wrapped 
up in a blazer, trying to keep warm.  One hand poked out for a moment so he could take a sip of his scotch 
that he carried in a brown bag and I saw had stained his teeth, then turned around to the monkeys.  He looked 
like he was trying to call to one of them, but none paid him any attention.  He quickly turned to look at us 
and I saw his eyes widen.  He got up and ran out away, and I thought that was the end of it.<br/>We went on 
with our day like every other family; each child was running, each mother was walking, and each brother was 
watching.  He saw lions and tigers and bears and more.  He got to pet every goat he wanted to.  But it was 
just a moment that I turned to see my mother as she told us it was getting late and we should head home that 
Adam ran off and we couldn&#x2019;t find him.  I was gasping for air looking in every direction, trying to 
decide which one to look in first.  My mother, father and I all split up to look for him, but we all found 
each other at the entrance again, all Adamless, and that&#x2019;s when it started.<br/>That same man that I 
had seen earlier that day was right there standing in front of us.  I didn&#x2019;t recognize him.  His hair 
was cut and his body was washed and he finally didn&#x2019;t smell like onions, liquor and mud.  He stood 
right by the same monkey cage that I saw him sitting by before.  His beard was now gray from the ash that 
dropped from the cigarette in his mouth.  In one hand, he had a gun, and from the way he held it, I knew he 
didn&#x2019;t know how to use it.<br/>He took the cigarette out of his mouth just to yell at us in a slightly 
British accent, &#x2018;Hey Jackson!&#x2019;  We all looked while he kept shouting.  &#x2018;I think you have 
something that belongs to me and I know that we both know what that is.&#x2019;  He turned to look at the 
monkey&#x2019;s cage, smiled, and turned his face back to us.  &#x2018;You know you&#x2019;re going to give 
it to me, so let&#x2019;s just make this quick, okay.&#x2019;  He started waving the gun directly at my 
father.<br/>My father started saying, &#x2018;Now, Floyd, listen,&#x2019; and that man demanded, 
&#x2018;No.  You listen to me.&#x2019;  He started waving the gun around frantically and everyone 
around us stopped.  &#x2018;This is my game where I make the rules, you understand.  You know that Kevin 
belongs to me.  You cannot come into my house and say that he&#x2019;s yours now.  I have rights just like 
everyone here.&#x2019;<br/>My father looked to him, deathly aware of the silence that grew and said, 
&#x2018;That chimp nearly beat a man to death.  The police were begging to take it away.&#x2019;<br/>The 
man waved a fist with his cigarette saying, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t call him an &#x2018;it&#x2019;.  
That&#x2019;s wrong.  That&#x2019;s not what you&#x2019;d want to be called.&#x2019;<br/>My father 
stood strong and said, &#x2018;I did you a favor.  Your only other option was euthanasia.&#x2019;  
And, of all the times to have finally found him, Adam came running from behind the gunman, yelling 
&#x2018;Ray, Ray, Ray.&#x2019;  The gunman snatched him and held him close to his body.  He pressed 
the gun up to Adam&#x2019;s head so unstably that I feared more that that the gun would go off by 
accident instead of intentionally.  Every single person who witnessed this held his breath as the 
gunman continued to speak.<br/>&#x2018;How interesting it is that you would say that, Mr. Jackson, 
because it seems you&#x2019;ve come across that very same problem.&#x2019;  Adam struggled to break 
free from him.  &#x2018;Your first option is that you give the chimp back to me.  Your only other 
option is euthanasia.&#x2019;  My mom covered her mouth, fearing the words that came out of his.<br/>I 
pleaded to Adam, &#x2018;Please don&#x2019;t fight back, please.  Just stay calm.&#x2019;<br/>The sun went 
even farther down in the sky and police sirens came closer and closer.  Suddenly, there were police 
everywhere.  Some stood behind tables, others sat in a van just outside of the zoo.  There were some 
of them on top of the buildings, and there was a helicopter with a spot light shining directly down 
on him and Adam.  As more cops came, it seems he was more and more prepared to shoot Adam.  I looked 
at him with that gun pressed so strongly to his head and crying.  It&#x2019;s surprising.  It seemed 
that now more than ever, Adam was aware of his mortality.  They sent a negotiator to us to try to 
help get Adam away from him.  The things that he started saying to him, no matter how calmly, only 
seemed to make things more intense.<br/>He told him, &#x2018;You know there&#x2019;s no win for you 
here.  We have your face and you in arms reach.  No matter how this goes, you&#x2019;re not leaving 
here with that monkey.&#x2019;<br/>The gunman shouted at him, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m getting him back.  
I&#x2019;m not leaving here without him.&#x2019;<br/>The negotiator told him, &#x2018;If anything 
happens to that boy, the only way you&#x2019;re leaving here is in a body bag.&#x2019;<br/>The 
gunman started crying, gritting his teeth and twitching. I saw the gun start to drop and he said, 
&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t want to hurt anyone.&#x2019;<br/>The negotiator asked him, &#x2018;Are you 
alright?&#x2019;<br/>He said, &#x2018;I need a smoke. Someone give me a cigarette.&#x2019; As the 
negotiator started to walk toward him and the gunman pointed his gun directly at him and shouted, 
&#x2018;No! Not you.  Him.&#x2019; And he pointed the gun at me.  The negotiator motioned for me 
to go to him.  He said, &#x2018;Reach into my pocket,&#x2019; and I pulled out a pack of 
Carroll&#x2019;s cigarettes and a matchbox.  I tried to hand them to him, but instead he told me 
to take one out and put it in his mouth.  He said really angrily at me, &#x2018;Now light it.&#x2019;<br/>I 
looked down at Adam whimpering and I said, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;m going to get you out of 
this.  I promised I would always protect you and I will.  I won&#x2019;t let anything happen, okay.&#x201d; 
Adam nodded his head and when I looked at the man, he was looking at that same monkey in the cage nearly in 
tears.  When they started to see the man begin to lower his gun, all the police men readied theirs, making 
the man jump back into his position and said, &#x2018;okay, now go back over there,&#x2019; and as I turned 
around and started to walk, I noticed my father&#x2019;s face looked a bit too satisfied.  We watched the 
gunman as he slowly sucked in the smoke and blowing it out of his nose.<br/>Clouds covered the sky and 
lightning began to flash.  Water fell lightly from the sky.  The negotiator said, &#x2018;Is there 
nothing else that you want instead of the monkey?&#x2019;<br/>The gunman yelled at him trying to hold 
in his cigarette with one lip, &#x2018;Are you kidding me!&#x2019;  Rain only grew harder and harder 
as he spoke.  &#x2018;I&#x2019;m came here for one purpose and one purpose only, I&#x2019;m caught up 
in a hostage situation here with, not just cops, but the SWAT too, and you think that I&#x2019;m going 
to settle?&#x2019;  The rain water put out his cigarette and he spit it to the ground and spoke with a 
straining voice.  &#x2018;No, this is serious shit here.  Either I get what I want and I walk out of 
here with what&#x2019;s mine in the next half hour, or this kid gets shot.&#x2019;<br/> Somehow, my 
father shrugged and said, &#x2018;So, shoot him.&#x2019;  Those words were so scary to me that I 
wanted my ears to bleed.  My mom smacked him across the shoulder.  Even the gunman looked at him 
in complete shock.  I could see Adam crushing his eyelids together, mouthing again and again, 
&#x2018;no, no, no&#x2026;&#x2019; and yet, my father kept talking.  &#x2018;You keep on saying 
you&#x2019;re going to do it, yet we&#x2019;ve been here for over three hours, and we&#x2019;re 
still here in the same situation.&#x2019;<br/>The gunman started yelling at my father, &#x2018;What?  
So, you don&#x2019;t think I will, huh?  Do you want proof, is that it!&#x2019; and he kept shoving 
the barrel deeper and deeper into Adam&#x2019;s head.<br/>The negotiator covered my father&#x2019;s 
mouth and quickly said, &#x2018;No, we&#x2019;ll get you anything you need.&#x2019;  Yet, my father 
freed himself and told the gunman with the most sincere confidence, &#x2018;Yes, I want you to do it, 
because I honestly don&#x2019;t think you will.&#x2019;<br/>Now I could hear Adam yelling through his 
tears, &#x2018;No! No! No!...&#x2019; Now everyone started yelling, &#x2018;I will shoot him!&#x2019; 
&#x2018;No, don&#x2019;t, please!&#x2019; &#x2018;Please, let me see you shoot him!&#x2019; &#x2018;No! 
No! No!&#x2019;  Under all the chaos, I couldn&#x2019;t think straight and I yelled out at him, &#x2018;Shoot 
me!&#x2019;<br/>All of a sudden, the gunman stopped yelling.  The entire place went silent.  He looked at me 
and said, &#x2018;What did you say?&#x2019; so I repeated myself, &#x2018;Shoot me instead.&#x2019;  He 
looked at me with a mix of confusion and empathy.  He said to me, &#x2018;You would take a bullet for him?  
You must be only eleven-years-old.&#x2019;  And I said to him, &#x2018;He&#x2019;s only five.  That means 
I&#x2019;ve lived more than twice as long as him.&#x2019;  He asked me, &#x2018;Why would you do 
that?&#x2019; and I told him, &#x2018;Because I love him.  That&#x2019;s my little brother and I 
promised I would always do anything to protect him.  I just want him to be safe.&#x2019;  Tears on 
his face were hidden under the rain and he looked at the monkey and, &#x2018;That&#x2019;s all I want 
for him.&#x2019;  I told him that all the animals were happy there and treated well.  He looked back 
at that same monkey that hadn&#x2019;t even looked back at him once.  His head dropped and the gun did 
too, but that barrel hit Adam&#x2019;s shoulder, and his finger was still on the trigger.  I heard a 
huge &#x2018;BANG!&#x2019; The gunman jumped back in shock.  Adam fell to the ground face first.  I 
used all the breath that I could to call out to him and every bit of energy to run to him.  I heard 
a police officer yell, &#x2018;Take him out!&#x2019;  Several other shots fired and the gunman fell 
to the ground.  They brought my dad to his knees and put handcuffs on him.  I know, in most cases, 
the shot would have been less than fatal, but&#x2026;Adam was a hemophiliac.  Red water rushed downhill 
from him.  I finally got to him.  I was on my knees, panting as if air was a rarity. Blood covered my 
hands and washed away in the rain.  Adam&#x2019;s small body lay on the ground in front of me.  His eyes 
were wide open.  They looked at me and his breath matched mine.  I grabbed him and put my head to his chest.  
I heard a beat fading away slowly as the pain in me grew.  I looked back up to his face.  Eyes were still 
wide open, but there was no more panting.  I held his little, lifeless body tightly and whispered to him, 
&#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x2019;<br/>This is the pistol he used to shoot my brother, and this is that same 
pack of cigarettes that he had me light for him,&#x201d; Ray said, showing Malik the gun and cigarettes.  
&#x201c;I swore that, if I ever saw his face again, I would sit him down, light one more cigarette for him, 
and just as he reached a high, I would shoot him.&#x201d;<br/>&#x201c;Ray, that was so many years ago.  Do 
you really think you remember what he looks like?&#x201d; Malik asked.<br/>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Ray answered, 
&#x201c;but I&#x2019;ll always remember what he sounded like, and I&#x2019;ve been devoted to hearing it 
every day.&#x201d;<br/>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; Malik said, &#x201c;are you saying your accent isn&#x2019;t 
real?&#x201d;<br/>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Ray said in an American accent, &#x201c;but I will speak like this 
for the rest of my life if I can give my brother vengeance.&#x201d;<br/>&#x201c;Ray, he&#x2019;s dead,&#x201d; 
Malik said. &#x201c;You told me yourself, they shot him once Adam was shot.&#x201d;<br/>&#x201c;I never trust 
the eye.  Looks are always deceiving,&#x201d; Ray said.  &#x201c;Always.&#x201d;<br/>
