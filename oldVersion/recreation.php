		<p>It's good to be a hard working person, but it's alo good to take a 
		little break one in a while and relax your mind.  There are a few ways 
		I do this.<p/>
		<p>One of the most obvious ways is to spend time with some friends.  I 
		think that's the way most people my age relax these days.  It's always 
		a great thing to have some people to spend time with and feel like 
		there's not a care in the world.  It really doesn't matter what we do.  
		We could be playing a game of football or sitting on the sofa.  They 
		both work the same.  I'm always in the mood to make new friends.  I 
		know that they can come from anywhere and I want friends from 
		everywhere.  But I think that some of my greatest friends have to be my 
		family.  No one can ever care as much and give me the push I need like 
		they do.  Sometimes I play a nice table game to take my mind off of everything 
		else.  Pool, ping pong, golf, video games, just something to take my 
		mind off of the world for a moment.</p>
		<h3>...And if those don't work, I take a nap.</h3>
