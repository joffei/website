		<p>So I guess it's pretty plain to see that computers and programming 
		haven't always been the love of my life, but writing is something that 
		has simply always felt good to do.</p>
		<p>I remember writing my first story when I was seven.  I don't know 
		why, but i just decided to take a pencil and paper and write whatever 
		was on my mind.  Somehow that turned into a story.  There really was 
		no plot to it, but a story no less.</p>
		<p>Today, I continue writing, but I don't just write stories.  I also 
		write scripts, poems, and everything in between.  Some of my work has 
		even been published.  This is my own little uniqueness and I cherish it.</p>
