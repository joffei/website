						<div style="padding:25px; color:white;">
							<p>&#9;On the island of Inaktu, off of the coast of Mir, there lived a woman, a woman beaten and battered so heavily that people wouldn't even look at her.  Even her own family couldn't stand the sight of her.  Never again would she be called by her true name. She would be called Insedite, meaning never loved.  Aphrodite was so sad for her, that she followed her around just hoping that someone true of heart would love her.</p>
							<p>&#9;One day, while crying her eyes out on a rock, a passerby, a man with good looks and obvious strength, came to comfort her.  He asked her "what is your name?" At hearing her name, he chuckled and said "Never shall I call you that, Mardise" meaning forever loved.  Mardise began to explain to the man how she became the way she was.  She told him that she even wondered why she refused to kill herself.  The man immediately stopped her and told her that it was because she knew that one day, she would meet a kind man.  Someone who wouldn't care about how she looks, and yet, say she is the most beautiful creature on earth.  Someone who wouldn't care about how she acts, and yet, would tell her that each move she makes is fluent and graceful.  Someone who wouldn't care about how she speaks, and yet, would tell her that her voice is cheerful and dulcet.  And that she knew that it was going to be on that day.  Mardise hadn't realized that the man was attempting to propose, but when she did, her eyes widened, her breath was taken away, and she drew a tear from her face.  She leapt into his arms and embraced him.  After that one moment, nothing felt better to him than her warm embrace.  Aphrodite was so moved that she blessed Mardise to be the most beautiful woman on the island.  They lived happily with each other.  Not in a big house and not with a lot of money, but just with each other.</p>
							<p>&#9;One day, however, a group of opposers from different islands came and took the women.  Mardise refused to go.  She struggled to get away and her husband began grabbing for her.  This struggle went on for an entire moon until Mardise's husband punched the man in the face causing his lip to begin gushing with blood.  At first the man looked stunned, but then he pulled from his side his sheath and lunged straight for him, when he moved aside.  And behind him, Mardise stood, taking the sheath straight through her own heart.  Seeing the look upon Mardise's husband's face, the man ran for his boat in fear and left the island.  Now closer than ever before, he held Mardise, just barely being able to hear her whisper her passing words, "I am Insedite".</p>
							<p>&#9;Even though very upset, her husband tried to live with it.  He wept the entire day feeling dead inside.  However, after the first day, he realized that he couldn't.  He took his sharpened dagger and thrust it through his heart.  As Hermes carried him down to the underworld, he noticed Hades' river of souls with Mardise in it.  He jumped in and swam for her.  While some souls tried to hold him back, the majority helped him, bearing in mind Hades promise that if any can retrieve a soul, theirs' would be restored.  With quick speed and slowly deteriorating skin, he lunged for Mardise with all his might.  As their fingertips grazed each other, there was a pull that brought them closer together until he had completely wrapped Mardise in his arms.  As they headed for earth, Hades realized what had just happened and attacked to kill him again.  Thankfully, being so close to earth, Hades only cut off his arms.  "You are Mardise," he said to Mardise panting for air.  Even with his newly restored life, he still felt dead, not being able to embrace his dear Mardise.</p>
