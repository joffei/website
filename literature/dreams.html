						<p>"I have a dream" - 4 words that don't really mean much, but have empowered 
						an entire race of people, but I'm not here to talk to you about race.  You see, 
						I have a dream, but in my dream, everyone is a soldier.  I'm not talking about 
						fatigues and boot camp and "Saving Private Ryan".  No, we don't wear 
						camouflage.  We're not trying to hide.  We carry a pistol of poetry in a holster 
						in our hearts fighting a war on hatred.  Each word that escapes our lips is a 
						shot that we hope hits the heart and brings humanity back to humans, and then 
						,once we stop hating, once we stop bullying, once we stop blaming the rest of 
						the world, leave the past in the past, work in the present, and love in the 
						future, once people can accept a person, be kind to a person, show love to a 
						person, not because that person is like them, but because that person is a 
						person, then I will say this war is over, but the thing about a dream is you 
						wake up, and you see what this world really is.  Stealing, beating, killing, it 
						all causes heart ache and it makes my heart ache.  It's time to stop dreaming.  
						I have no dream, I have a goal; to make you show love to your neighbor, the one 
						to your right, your left, in front of you, behind you, across from you, over in 
						the corner where you can't see him, but you know he's there.  I want a country 
						to show love to its neighbor country, and make a unified heart beat that the 
						world can hear and the rest will synchronize.  This is no longer a dream, but a 
						goal, because if you don't pursue your dreams, they'll stay just that...dreams.</p>
