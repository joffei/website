							<p>It's good to be a hard working person, but it's alo good to take a 
							little break one in a while and relax your mind.  There are a few ways 
							I do this.<p/>
							<p>One of the most obvious ways is to spend time with some friends.  I 
							think that's the way most people my age relax these days.  It's always 
							a great thing to have some people to spend time with and feel like 
							there's not a care in the world.  It really doesn't matter what we do.  
							We could be playing a game of football or sitting on the sofa.  They 
							both work the same.  I'm always in the mood to make new friends.  I 
							know that they can come from anywhere and I want friends from 
							everywhere.  But I think that some of my greatest friends have to be my 
							family.  No one can ever care as much and give me the push I need like 
							they do.  Sometimes I play a nice table game to take my mind off of everything 
							else.  Pool, ping pong, golf, video games, just something to take my 
							mind off of the world for a moment.</p>
							<h3>...And if those don't work, I take a nap.</h3>
