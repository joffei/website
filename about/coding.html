						<p>Allow me to tell you a little story.</p>
						<p><del>Once Upon a Time...</del> Not that kind of story</p>
						<p>During my Junior year of High School, I had a study class with a 
						very nice guy.  Everyone knew him as the "Computer Geek".  At this 
						school, though, it has never been a bad thing to be a geek.  In fact, 
						geeks are the most popular.  Every day, I saw him on his computer, 
						typing what looked like an absolute mess.</p>
						<p>&quot;What's 'int'?  What's with all the semicolons and braces? Why is 
						the spacing so weird?&quot;</p>
						<p>Once he started talking to me about what he was doing, I was quikly 
						hooked.  However, it was anything but easy for me to start 
						understanding all of this back-end work.  I was stubborn though.  I 
						simply refused to let these machines get the better of me.</p>
						<p>When the next year came along, there was one new class that caaught 
						my attention: &quot;Computer Science: Java.&quot;  I didn't even have time 
						to consider.  My hand had already checked the box.  In the first day of 
						class, the teacher gave us this assignment: Write the instructions to 
						make a peanutbutter and jelly sandwich...<span style="color:red">Everyone 
						failed</span>.  Yet, somehow, I ended up loving it.  Now I'm majoring in it.</p>
						<p>By the time I left high school.  I only knew one language strongly.
						Now I'm learning new languages whenever I can.</p>
